  <h1>Sample Results for Commons-Math (Okt. 2016)</h1>
    <p>Compile and Tests, single-module project, 4 CPU laptop, as measured by GNU time. The value shown is the real (wall clock) time spend on the process.</p>

  <h2>Clean build from scratch</h2>

    <p>
      Sbt is quickest, by using all CPUs to the fullest. During the test, my system became unusable, the mouse crawling over the screen like a snail. Overall the other buildsystems doing parallelization show that 140 seconds is a reasonable number while keeping the system usable.
    </p>


  <h2>Rebuild without changes</h2>

<div id="chart2" class='with-3d-shadow with-transitions chart'>
    <svg></svg>
</div>

<p>Several buildsystems recognize there is nothing to do, surprisingly pants is not among them.<p>

  <h2>Rebuild with change</h2>

<p>For this case I added a small no-op change to one source file.</p>

<div id="chart3" class='with-3d-shadow with-transitions chart'>
    <svg></svg>
</div>

<p>Since this is a single-module build, all buildsystems run all tests again after a file change.<p>

    <h2>Rebuild first version</h2>

<p>For this case I manually reverted the file to the state of the first build.</p>
    
<div id="chart4" class='with-3d-shadow with-transitions chart'>
    <svg></svg>
</div>

<p>While I had expected bazel and buck to reuse a version from their cache, it seems they did not. I am not sure why not, possibly they do take into account timestamps for identifying same builds. In other scenarios, at least bazel used results from a cache.<p>

    <h2>Clean build file Ops</h2>

<div id="chart5" class='with-3d-shadow with-transitions chart'>
    <svg></svg>
</div>

Here are the numbers of file system input and outputs as reported by GNU time for the clean builds. Some buildsystems have a value of zero, probably because their setup involves separate processes not covered by GNU time.
